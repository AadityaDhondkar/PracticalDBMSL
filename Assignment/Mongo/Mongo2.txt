MongoDB Queries for Institute Database and Student Collection

This file outlines the instructions for creating a MongoDB database, creating a collection, and performing CRUD operations such as inserting documents, retrieving data, and applying updates.


1. Set Up MongoDB Environment

Before proceeding with the instructions, ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. You can download it from MongoDB Official Site (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). After installing MongoDB, you can start it by using the command mongod (for Linux/MacOS) or running the MongoDB server via the MongoDB Compass application.


2. Create Database and Collection

2.1 Create Database `Institute`

To create the `Institute` database, use the following command:

use Institute

This command switches to the `Institute` database. If the database doesn't already exist, MongoDB will create it when you insert data into it.

2.2 Create Collection `Students`

To create a collection named `Students`, you don't need to explicitly create it. MongoDB will automatically create the collection when you insert the first document. However, if you want to explicitly create it, you can use the following command:

db.createCollection("Students")


3. Insert 10 Documents into the `Students` Collection

Insert 10 documents into the `Students` collection with the following structure:

db.Students.insertMany([
    { 
        RollNo: 1, 
        Name: "John Doe", 
        Age: 23, 
        Branch: "Computer Science", 
        Address: { City: "New York", State: "NY" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Reading", "Swimming"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 2, 
        Name: "Jane Smith", 
        Age: 21, 
        Branch: "Electrical Engineering", 
        Address: { City: "Los Angeles", State: "CA" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Painting", "Cycling"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 3, 
        Name: "Alice Johnson", 
        Age: 24, 
        Branch: "Mechanical Engineering", 
        Address: { City: "Chicago", State: "IL" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Traveling", "Cooking"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 4, 
        Name: "Bob Lee", 
        Age: 20, 
        Branch: "Civil Engineering", 
        Address: { City: "Houston", State: "TX" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Photography", "Hiking"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 5, 
        Name: "Mary Wilson", 
        Age: 22, 
        Branch: "Computer Science", 
        Address: { City: "San Francisco", State: "CA" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Writing", "Music"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 6, 
        Name: "David Brown", 
        Age: 25, 
        Branch: "Physics", 
        Address: { City: "Boston", State: "MA" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Astronomy", "Chess"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 7, 
        Name: "Sophia Clark", 
        Age: 19, 
        Branch: "Mathematics", 
        Address: { City: "Dallas", State: "TX" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Reading", "Jogging"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 8, 
        Name: "James Miller", 
        Age: 23, 
        Branch: "Biology", 
        Address: { City: "Seattle", State: "WA" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Birdwatching", "Camping"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 9, 
        Name: "Isabella Davis", 
        Age: 22, 
        Branch: "Literature", 
        Address: { City: "Miami", State: "FL" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Writing", "Dancing"] 
    },
    { 
        RollNo: 10, 
        Name: "Ethan Martinez", 
        Age: 21, 
        Branch: "Chemistry", 
        Address: { City: "San Diego", State: "CA" }, 
        Hobbies: ["Gardening", "Cooking"] 
    }
])


4. Display All Students' Information

To display all student information in the `Students` collection, use the following query:

db.Students.find().pretty()

The pretty() method will format the output to be more readable.


5. Update Student Branch for RollNo 3

To update the `Branch` of the student with `RollNo` 3 (for example, change it to "Computer Engineering"), use the following query:

db.Students.updateOne(
    { RollNo: 3 },
    { $set: { Branch: "Computer Engineering" } }
)

This will update the `Branch` field for the student with `RollNo` 3.


6. Remove Document with RollNo 1

To remove the document with `RollNo` 1, use the following query:

db.Students.deleteOne({ RollNo: 1 })

This will remove the student document where the `RollNo` is 1.


7. Conclusion

With these commands, you have:

1. Created a database `Institute`.
2. Created a collection `Students`.
3. Inserted 10 student documents into the collection.
4. Displayed student information with the `find()` method.
5. Updated a student's branch using the `updateOne()` method.
6. Removed a student document using the `deleteOne()` method.

Feel free to modify or extend these queries as per your requirements for further operations such as updates, deletions, or more complex filtering.
